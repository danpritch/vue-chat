# Vue Chess

## Description

This example project, a chess game, exists to demonstrate that I have the capability to build an application that uses the technologies:

* Spring Boot
* Kafka
* VueJS

## User journeys

1. The user visits the website and creates a "player".
2. The "player" can see many "players" in a lobby, and "challenge" another "player" who is not currently involved in a "game". The "player" can see current "games", and historical "games".
3. A "player" can accept or reject a "challenge".
4. If a "player" accepts a "challenge", the "players" will immediately play a "game".
5. Each "player" takes a turn to make a "move".
6. The "players" make "moves" until a checkmate "move", then the "game" is finished, the "players" return to the lobby.
